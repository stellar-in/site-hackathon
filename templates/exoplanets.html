                    <h1>Exoplanets</h1>
                    <p>An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, but some
                        free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, are untethered to any star.</p>

                <h2>So far scientists have categorized exoplanets into the following types: Gas giant, Neptunian,
                    super-Earth and terrestrial.</h2>
                <p>The planets beyond our solar system are called “exoplanets,” and they come in a wide variety of
                    sizes, from gas giants larger than Jupiter to small, rocky planets about as big around as Earth or
                    Mars. They can be hot enough to boil metal or locked in deep freeze. They can orbit their stars so
                    tightly that a “year” lasts only a few days; they can orbit two suns at once. Some exoplanets are
                    sunless rogues, wandering through the galaxy in permanent darkness.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Detecting methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radial velocity</li>
                    <li>Transit</li>
                    <li>Direct imaging</li>
                    <li>Gravitational microlensing</li>
                    <li>Astrometry</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are many methods of detecting exoplanets. Transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy have
                    found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of
                    planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone. In
                    several cases, multiple planets have been observed around a star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars[a]
                    have an "Earth-sized"[b] planet in the habitable zone. Assuming there are 200 billion stars
                    in the Milky Way,[d] it can be hypothesized that there are 11 billion potentially habitable
                    Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red
                    dwarfs are included. </p>

                <p>The least massive exoplanet known is Draugr (also known as PSR B1257+12 A or PSR B1257+12 b), which
                    is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive exoplanet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive
                    is HR 2562 b, about 30 times the mass of Jupiter. However, according to some definitions
                    of a planet (based on the nuclear fusion of deuterium), it is too massive to be a planet and
                    might be a brown dwarf. Known orbital times for exoplanets vary from less than an hour (for those
                    closest to their star) to thousands of years. Some exoplanets are so far away from the star that it
                    is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to it. </p>

                <p>Almost all planets detected so far are within the Milky Way. However, there is evidence that
                    extragalactic planets, exoplanets located in other galaxies, may exist. The nearest
                    exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri, the
                    closest star to the Sun.</p>

                <p>The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There
                    is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone (sometimes called "goldilocks
                    zone"), where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life as we know it, to exist on
                    the surface. However, the study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other
                    factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.</p>

                <p>Rogue planets are those that do not orbit any star. Such objects are considered a separate category
                    of planets, especially if they are gas giants, often counted as sub-brown dwarfs. The rogue
                    planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more.</p>
