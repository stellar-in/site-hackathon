                    <h2>The Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Size, mass</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the time of its discovery, Kepler-78b was the exoplanet most similar to Earth in terms of
                        mass,
                        radius,
                        and mean density. The planet is approximately 1.69 times the mass and 1.12 times the radius of
                        Earth.
                        The acceleration due to gravity on the planet's surface is about 11 m/s2 (25 mph/s), slightly
                        greater than
                        Earth's surface gravity. Two independent teams were involved in pioneering work to estimate the
                        planet's
                        mass. Their estimates were made possible because Kepler-78b's gravity causes a "wobble" in the
                        orbit
                        of the
                        host star. While the method has been used to characterize gas giants, it is difficult to
                        estimate
                        the mass
                        of Earth-sized exoplanets, because their gravity is too weak to produce a visible influence. In
                        this
                        case,
                        the planet's orbit is close enough to its star to produce a detectable effect.</p>

                    <p>One team, led by Francesco Pepe, used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher-North
                        (HARPS-N)
                        spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the Canary Islands[10] to estimate that the
                        planet has a
                        mass 1.86 times that of the Earth and a radius 1.16 times greater. The other, led by Andrew
                        Howard
                        of the
                        University of Hawaii at Manoa, used data from the High Resolution Eschelle Spectrometer at the
                        W.M.
                        Keck
                        Observatory in Hawaii to estimate the mass as 1.69 times that of the Earth and the radius as
                        1.12
                        times
                        larger. Both estimates put the planet's density at about 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter (0.20
                        pounds
                        per
                        cubic inch), equivalent to Earth's density. This measurement is possibly indicative of a
                        rock-iron
                        composition like Earth's. The iron core could build up to 40% of the planet mass.

                        Kepler-78b is most similar to larger high-density, hot exoplanets like Kepler-10b, Kepler-36b
                        and
                        CoRoT-7b.</p>
                    
                    <div class="ss"><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Lava_World_Kepler_78b.jpg/220px-Lava_World_Kepler_78b.jpg"

                    <h2>Environment</h2>
                    <p>Kepler-78b orbits around its parent star once every 8.5 hours. It reflects 20% to 60% of the
                        starlight it
                        receives. Due to its extremely close solar orbit, which is about 40 times closer than Mercury is
                        to the
                        Sun, the planet's surface is estimated to be at a temperature of 2,300 K (2,030 째C; 3,680 째F) to
                        3,100 K
                        (2,830 째C; 5,120 째F). This temperature is high enough to have stripped the planet of any stable
                        atmosphere, but the liquid and solid portions of the planet should be stable. According to
                        Francesco
                        Pepe, the planet may be Earth-sized, but "it can be imagined like a lava planet rather than an
                        Earth-like
                        planet".</p>
